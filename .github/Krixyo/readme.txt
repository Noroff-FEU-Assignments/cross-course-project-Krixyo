Hi.

I took my old code and converted it from what i have learned to have something to send in and to build on further. CSS was very difficult for me.

I mean this situation with the cross course subjects where I haven't resited the mediadesign yet should be more on your shoulders than mine. 

Its more of a impossible task to build on nothing, but I used what I have and I hope you could see it for what it is, my best try. 

Have a nice day.
